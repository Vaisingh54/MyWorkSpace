                Young Gerald, uh


                This is the anthem
                Told the world I need everything and some
                Two girls that's a tandem
                She gon' do all it for me when them bands come
                Got it all, yeah I am young, rich, and handsome
                Uh, This shit is not random
                Everybody ain't got it, understand son

                This shit is not random

                It's my world and I do what I like to
                I know she gon' be ready when I slide through
                If you forgot I got it, then I'll remind you
                Cause I got what they got
                I am talking times two
                Disagree with me and you've been lied to
                I am nothing like you and no, I'm not the type to
                Follow bullshit y'all give the hype to
                I can see the fakes, so when I look in your direction
                Understand I am seeing right through
                You're hollow, you follow?
                Everybody's not the real McCoy
                Worldwide, yeah, they feel the boy
                California out to Georgia, Florida and up to Illinois
                When I listen to your music, I just feel annoyed
                Haters, I don't understand them
                Bred Jordan Ones from two thousand and one

                Today I think I want a Phantom
                If I don't get it I am throw a fucking tantrum, woah

                This is the anthem
                Told the world I need everything and some
                Two girls that's a tandem
                She gon' do it for me when them bands come
                Got it all, I am young, rich, and handsome

                This shit is not random
                Everybody ain't got it, understand son
                This shit is not random

                Now imagine it, put the hours in and stay passionate
                Wasn't blowing money, I was stacking it
                Figured what the fuck I want to do in life and practiced it
                Pay attention, none of this is happening by accident
                Listen, I don't slack a bit
                Game plan solid, no cracks in it
                Said I want a billion now nothing less is adequate
                Grab and check, cashing it
                I was born addicted to the money
                Difference is now if finally found a way to manage it
                What you think I pay for nothing?
                You must be mistaken someone
                I had to go make that fund and I'm trying to be great at something Spend not, saving nothing

                Flying from the bay to London
                They say that money talks but you're not saying nothing
                Now try and shade me, I'm like I guess
                Why yes, you drive a Toyota, please define flex
                Sign CDs and I sign breasts
                Understand, to these female fans, I'm sex

                This is the anthem
                Told the world I need everything and some
                Two girls that's a tandem
                She gon' do it for me when them bands come
                I got it all, I am young, rich, and handsome
                This shit is not random
                Everybody ain't got it, understand son
                This shit is not random
